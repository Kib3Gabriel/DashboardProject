## **Project Overview**

### **Description**
**[Project Name]** is a web-based platform designed to **[insert core functionality]**. It provides users with an interactive environment to **[describe key features, e.g., manage courses, access resources, participate in real-time Q&A, etc.]**. The platform is built with modern web technologies, utilizing a React frontend for a smooth user experience and a Node.js backend to handle business logic and database operations.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, CSS (or SCSS), Axios for API requests
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MySQL (or other DB), JWT Authentication, Multer (for file uploads)
- **Other Tools**: Socket.io (for real-time communication), dotenv (for environment configuration)

## **Project Architecture**

### **Frontend Architecture**
The frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, ensuring type safety and scalability. The key structure is as follows:

- **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI components like `Button.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`.
- **`src/pages/`**: Contains page components representing the main views (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`).
- **`src/assets/`**: Stores static files like images and fonts.
- **`src/utils/`**: Includes utility functions like API requests, validation helpers, etc.
- **`src/contexts/`**: Contains context providers for global state (e.g., authentication context).
- **`src/hooks/`**: Custom hooks for reusable logic (e.g., `useAuth`, `useFetch`).

### **Backend Architecture**
The backend is structured with **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, implementing **RESTful APIs** and connecting to a **MySQL database** (or another DB). The structure is as follows:

- **`controllers/`**: Contains the logic to handle requests (e.g., `userController.ts`, `courseController.ts`).
- **`models/`**: Defines the data structure and queries for interacting with the database (e.g., `userModel.ts`, `productModel.ts`).
- **`routes/`**: Contains the route definitions for the API endpoints (e.g., `authRoutes.ts`, `productRoutes.ts`).
- **`middleware/`**: Holds middleware for authentication, error handling, etc. (e.g., `authMiddleware.ts`, `errorHandler.ts`).
- **`config/`**: Configuration files such as database connection, JWT secret, and other environment variables.
- **`services/`**: Contains reusable services for business logic that is decoupled from controllers (optional).

### **Frontend-Backend Integration**
- The frontend communicates with the backend through **HTTP requests** using `axios` or `fetch`.
- **JWT Authentication**: The frontend stores JWT tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` after login and sends them with each API request in the `Authorization` header for secure access.
- The backend authenticates these tokens using middleware and processes the data accordingly.

## **Key Features**

### **Frontend Features**
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT tokens.
- **Real-Time Q&A**: Powered by **Socket.io** to provide real-time interactions between students and instructors.
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, edit, and manage courses while students can access learning materials and participate in discussions.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

### **Backend Features**
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based user authentication for secure and scalable login sessions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting courses, users, and other entities.
- **Database Interaction**: Integration with MySQL (or another DB) to persist user and course data.
- **File Uploads**: Secure file handling with **Multer** to allow students and instructors to upload resources.
